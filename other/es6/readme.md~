### Introduction

The ES6 specification was finalized in June 2015, (hence ES2015)

Future versions of the specification will follow the ES[YYYY] pattern, e.g ES2016 for ES7

### Tooling

To get ES6 working today, you need a JavaScript-to-JavaScript transpiler

Babel (a transpiler) has a killer feature: human-readable output

Use `babel` to transpile ES6 into ES5 for static builds

Use `babelify` to incorporate babel into your Gulp,or npm run build process

Use `babel-node` with any version of node, as it transpiles modules into ES5

Babel has a thriving ecosystem that already supports some of ES2016 and has plugin support

### Assignment Destructuring

`var {foo} = pony` is equivalent to `var foo = pony.foo`

`var {foo:baz} = pony` is equivalent to `var baz = pony.foo`

You can provide default values, var {foo='bar'} = baz yields foo:'bar'
